# Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino
Made this project for my 4th Semester Sub -> Computer Organization and Architecture 

Things you'll need :
1) Arduino (Any version)
2) Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
3) Connecting Wires
4) Python Installed ( Visual Python ) 2.7v


Working of the project is simple. Launch the Python program and place an object before the US sensor

Now launch the python program and you should be able to notice the white rectangle move along with your object,
the distance between your object and sensor will also be displayed in the shell window.

This is how we can track the motion of object using Ultrasonic sensor and Python with Arduino.

Hope you understood the project and enjoyed building one, 
This is just one subtle step towards python but you can build a lot more creative things using this.

## NOTE : 

* Make the change in the python code, and choose the com port as per your Arduino.

* Choose the Echo and Trigger pin as per your Arduino ports.

* Install Vpython and Serial with the help of pip "install"
